# Jim Murphy – CV

This repository contains the source files for generating my professional CV using R Markdown and the [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) package with the [awesome-cv](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template. It deploys to Github pages using a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow.

## Contents
- `Jim-Murphy-CV.Rmd` – R Markdown file for the CV. 
- `.github/workflows/render-cv.yml` – GitHub Actions workflow to automatically knit the CV on push.
